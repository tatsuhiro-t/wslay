Wslay is a WebSocket library written in C.
It implements the protocol version 13 described in
RFC 6455 http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455.
This library offers 2 levels of API:
event-based API and frame-based low-level API. For event-based API, it
is suitable for non-blocking reactor pattern style. You can set
callbacks in various events. For frame-based API, you can send
WebSocket frame directly. Wslay only supports data transfer part of
WebSocket protocol and does not perform opening handshake in HTTP.

Wslay supports:

* Text/Binary messages.
* Automatic ping reply.
* Callback interface.
* External event loop.

Wslay does not perform any I/O operations for its own. Instead, it
offers callbacks for them. This makes Wslay independent on any I/O
frameworks, SSL, sockets, etc.  This makes Wslay protable across
various platforms and the application authors can choose freely I/O
frameworks.
